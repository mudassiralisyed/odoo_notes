first of all for making new envoirment i have to go in the directory where i have to make an module
so there is the key for doing this through terminal 

cd custom/enviorments/programming/flectra/env
it will take to me env folder where i have to make moduel 

then i have to make virutal enviorment for that module by that command it will create the envoirment and also make the folder of that moduel with its name

virtualenv -p python3 name_of_moduel
a folder will created with its dependencies 

now we have to activate the our moduel into source file by giving command of 

source name_of_module/bin/activate

now we have to go back in flectra directory and now we for that purpose we use cd .. command
now we are in flectra folder and have to install its requirements which necsssary for our module 
we use this command 
pip3 install -r src/flectra/requirements.txt
 this will install our requirements in moduel
 next we have configure our module with flectra
and if we deactivate our module envoirnment and then again run this command it will install all the lib inthe python 

src/flectra/flectra-bin -sc env/env_learning/config/config.cfg
then stop it by using ctrl+c command 

ab scaffold cmnd sa moduel bnao apny env k andar addon k folder ma

src/flectra/flectra-bin scaffold learning env/env_learning/addons
our module is created and now we have to do last which is configure the addon path with config file for that we have to copy the addons file by ctrl+c and paste into the config file after inserting , 
in addons_path =

after this we have to open the module folder in pycharm and configure it 
with our module 
/home/mudassar/custom/enviorments/programming/flectra/src/flectra/flectra-bin
by giving this script path into pycharm 

and by setting parameter to 
-c /home/mudassar/custom/enviorments/programming/flectra/env/env_learning/config/config.cfg -u learning
in this -u means to update the moduel by every time automaticly
